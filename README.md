# Fun facts

This is just a simple static web site with some fun facts. 
It is built in order to learn React basics:

- JSX
- Custom components
- Styling (using CSS classes)

P.S. All of the content that is displayed on the page has been hardcoded directly into the components.

## How to run this app:

1. Clone this repo `git clone https://github.com/sigii1992/Fun-facts.git`
2. `cd Fun-facts`, `cd my-app`
3. run `npm start`
